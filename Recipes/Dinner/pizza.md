## Ingredients

### Pizza Crust
- 3 1/3 cups flour
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 2 packets of yeast
- 1 3/4 tsp salt
- 1 cup water
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 can tomato paste
- spices and toppings as desired

### Other
- 1 tbsp flour
- 1 tbsp cornmeal
- 1 tbsp olive oil

## Prep

Combine flour, sugar, yeast, and salt thoroughly. 

Add water and mix.

At after this has been thoroughly mixed the dough may be a bit dry, add additional water in small amounts as necessary.

Add 2 tbsp olive oil to the dough and knead for 2-3 minutes.

Roll the dough out to fit your pan, but do not place it on the pan. 

Combine 1 tbsp of flour and 1 tbsp cornmeal and set aside.

Apply a small amount of olive oil to the surface of your pan and lightly spread the flour-cornmeal mixture; this will prevent your pizza from sticking to thee pan and falling apart as you cut slices.

Spread the tomato paste on the dough leaving about 3/4" of un-sauced crust on the edge. Evenly apply spices. (I recommend oregano, garlic, italian seasoning, basil and parsley)

I'm not going to be covering pizza toppings here, since everyone has their own pizza topping preferences. Apply pizza toppings as desired.
